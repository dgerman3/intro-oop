# Lab: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in C#

## Objective
In this lab, you will be enhancing an existing object-oriented system by adding a new `Square` class. You will need to write the class definition, implement its methods, and then incorporate it into the `Main` method of the `Program` class.

## Tasks
1. **Create the `Square` class**: Create a new class named `Square` that inherits from the `Shape` abstract class. This class should have a single field `_side` for the length of the square's side. This field should be set via the constructor. The `Square` class should override the `Area` method from the `Shape` class to return the area of the square (i.e., the square of its side length).

2. **Update the `Main` method**: Once you've created the `Square` class, you need to add an instance of `Square` to the `shapes` array and `names` array in the `Main` method of the `Program` class.
