| 3. (Free Response) Explain why `Shape` is an abstract class and why it might be useful to make it abstract.                                                               | `Shape` is an abstract class because it represents a general concept of a shape, and we can't or don't want to create an instance of "Shape" directly. It's useful because it allows us to define methods that all shapes must have (like `Area`), but we can defer the implementation of these methods to the subclasses. |
| 4. (Multiple Choice) Which class(es) implement the `INameable` interface? <br> a) Circle <br> b) Triangle <br> c) Shape <br> d) Dog <br> e) All of the above              | e) All of the above                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 5.

(Free Response) What is the purpose of the `INameable` interface in the given code?                                                                                    | The `INameable` interface allows objects of different classes to respond to the `GetName` method. This is useful when we want to process objects of different classes in a polymorphic manner.                                                                                                                             |
| 7. (Multiple Choice) If a `Square` object is created with side length 2.0, what will be the output of the `Area` method? <br> a) 2.0 <br> b) 4.0 <br> c) 8.0 <br> d) 16.0 | b) 4.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 8.

| 9. (Free Response) How does the `Program` class use polymorphism?                                                                                                         | The `Program` class uses polymorphism by treating `Circle`, `Triangle`, and `Square` objects as `Shape` objects and calling the `Area` method on them. It also treats `Circle`, `Triangle`, `Square`, and `Dog` objects as `INameable` objects and calls the `GetName` method on them.                                     |
